# earthwafer

Idea to produce a flick-book depiction of the surface and subsurface of an area (initially the Loser Plateau in Austria). Cross-sectional 'wafers' of landscape profiles corresponding to a given width (1 pixel of terrain data) are generated and then cut out and joined together somehow. the cave passages are incorperated as projected cut-out 'wormholes' in the subsurface, so when you flick through its as though you are watching the passages develop, or as if you are travelling along them.
